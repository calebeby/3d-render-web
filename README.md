Ideas going forward:

- Phased solving (by piece type)
- Evaluation of "distance from solved"

  Currently:

  - Number of piece faces that are correct
  - Number of pieces that are correct

  Future:

  - Minimum number of turns for each piece to be in the correct position and oriented correctly

- Continue to integrate trie for most-similar move set to minimize metamove effects and see how it works
